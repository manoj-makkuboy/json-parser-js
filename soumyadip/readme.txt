For a json parser, we can first break the whole of json string into sub-strings like - {"soumya"} => "{"s""o""u""m""y""a""}" and {"1+2+3"} => "{"1""+""2""+""3""}" now we have to run a check on each of the characters like "[" & "]" for array and integers for numeric values and if "" => empty string, and {} for null. and we can return the result based on the check. For errors we can either return the error or some "Invalid JSON" message.
